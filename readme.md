LoRa Pico Cell Gateway project - MCU firmware
=============================================


## 1. Components
----------------

This directory contains the sources code of the Keil project to build a Picocell
Gateway MCU firmware based on the Semtech LoRa Picocell Gateway reference
design.
The target MCU is a STM32F401CD. The firmware implements either a USB CDC
protocol or a UART protocol to bridge commands coming from host to the SX1308
SPI interface.
The embedded firmware takes in charge the power management of the SX1308 during
the downlink to respect the 500MA max power constraint in the USB plug.

### 1.1. MAIN ###

The MAIN/ directory contains the main program that runs on the MCU, which
launches the USB/UART commands interpreter to communicate with the Host.

### 1.2. CmdUSB ###

The CmdUSB/ directory contains the USB/UART command interpreter to handle the
communication between the Host and the concentrator. It is a bridge to the HAL
which communicates with the SX1308 through SPI.

### 1.3. usb_cdc ###

The STM32 USB CDC library modified for this reference design.

### 1.4. SX1308HAL ###

The LoRa concentrator Hardware Abstraction Layer C library to configure the
hardware, send and receive packets.


## 2. Precompiled binaries
--------------------------

The bin/ directory contains the precompiled binary files in .hex or .dfu
formats, for both USB and UART communication bridges.
To load the binary file into the target MCU flash memory, you have to:

### 2.1. USB

* Make the MCU enter DFU mode:
    - either press the BOOT0 button of the PicoCell GW while plugging it to the
    host USB port
    - or use the util_boot tool provided with the picoGW_hal repository.

* Program the binary into the MCU flash memory:
    - use a tool like dfu-util (http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net).

    ex:
    ```
    dfu-util -a 0 -D pgw_fw_usb.dfu
    ```

    Note: you may have to use sudo depending on your priviledges.

* Unplug/replug USB PicoCell GW to exit DFU mode.


### 2.2. UART

* Make the MCU enter UART bootloader:
    - either press the BOOT0 button of the PicoCell GW while plugging it to the
    host USB port
    - or use the util_boot tool provided with the picoGW_hal repository.

* Program the binary into the MCU flash memory:
    - use a tool like stm32flash (https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm32flash)

    ex:
    ```
    stm32flash -b 115200 /dev/ttyS0 -v -w pgw_fw_uart.hex -g 0x0
    ```


## 3. Build the project
-----------------------

In order to compile the whole project, a Keil project is provided in the src/
directory. Open the pgw.uvproj file in Keil and rebuild all.

By default, it builds the project for using USB communication bridge. In order
to use the UART instead, uncomment the following line in src/MAIN/board.h before
building all the project.

```
#define USE_UART 1
```

After the compilation as succeeded, a Pgw.hex file is created in the bin/
directory. It is the file to be programmed in the MCU flash memory. Refer to
section 2 of this document to get information for flashing.
A DFU file can be created from this .hex file using the "Dfu file manager" tool
provided by STmicroelectronics.
